# mlagent-simplest-training
This is the simplest mlagent training example I could think of. there is a cube it can move in four directions, Train it to move to the right. Reward it for moving right and punish it for moving in other directions.  Because this tutorial is simplest, we can focus on the vectorObservation, vectorAction and how the affect the neural network brain we are trying to create. We use stacked vectors to give in put to the neural network, providing it with a sense of action over time. That will help train it better.
